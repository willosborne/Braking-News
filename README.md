# Braking-News
This is a little game I made in about 48 hours for the Game Maker's Toolkit Jam 2018, using GameMaker Studio 2. 

The objective is to deliver newspapers to mailboxes (by firing them from your newspaper shotgun). 
You get paid something like $2000 for every newspaper. Unfortunately, your car has no brakes,
and the area is littered with other cars, fire trucks, dustbins and hapless pedestrians.

It's rather difficult to get a positive score, but I think the final product is really fun - basically just a big exercise in polish.
If you'd like to play the game, this isn't really the best way to do it - instead, check out my itch.io page [here](https://noogai03.itch.io/braking-news-post-jam)

## Source code
I did some fun things with this game. Firstly, all the moving objects are rendered in pseudo-3D by stacking 2D sprites - I think it looks pretty cool!
I've also used a separate render texture to contain tyre tracks (you can do donuts!) and blood splatters, the technique for which was 
based on Hotline Miami of all things...

Have fun! Hopefully you can glean something from the chaos - here be monsters.
